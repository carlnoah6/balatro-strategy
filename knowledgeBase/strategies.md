## Joker Tier List

### S+ Tier (Run-Defining)
| Joker | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Blueprint** | Copies the ability of any adjacent Joker. Find one broken Joker and Blueprint doubles it. Works with Brainstorm, Perkeo, Yorick. |
| **Brainstorm** | Copies the leftmost Joker's ability. Combined with Blueprint creates triple-effect chains. |
| **Triboulet** | Gives x2 Mult for each King and Queen played. Insane with face card builds. |

### S Tier (Build Carriers)
| Joker | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Vampire** | Absorbs enhancements from played cards, gaining xMult. Scales infinitely with enhanced cards. |
| **Cavendish** | x3 Mult. Appears after Gros Michel is destroyed. One of the strongest flat xMult jokers. |
| **The Duo** | x2 Mult if hand contains a Pair. Trivially easy to trigger. |
| **The Trio** | x2 Mult if hand contains Three of a Kind. |
| **The Family** | x2 Mult if hand contains Four of a Kind. |
| **Spare Trousers** | +2 Mult every time you play a hand containing Two Pair. Scaling multiplier. |
| **Canio** | Legendary. xMult increases when any playing card is destroyed. Snowballs hard. |
| **Campfire** | xMult increases when you sell a Joker. Resets when Boss Blind is selected. |
| **DNA** | Clones first card played each round permanently into deck. Tightens synergies over time. |

### A Tier (Strong Picks)
| Joker | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Hiker** | Permanently adds +5 Chips to every played card. Snowballs over entire run. |
| **Fortune Teller** | +1 Mult per Tarot used this run. Rewards natural Tarot usage. Can be +20-40 by late game. |
| **Rocket** | Earn $1/round, +$2 when Boss Blind defeated. Solves economy if picked Ante 1-2. |
| **Seltzer** | Retrigger all played cards for 10 hands. Doubles all card-based Joker effects. |
| **Trading Card** | Destroy 1 card on first discard for $3. Deck thinning + economy. |
| **Bloodstone** | 1/3 chance Hearts give x2 Mult. Build-around for Heart Flush. |
| **Perkeo** | Legendary. Creates Negative copy of a consumable at end of shop. Enables infinite Hermit/Planet loops. |
| **Hologram** | Gains xMult when a card is added to deck. Pairs with DNA. |
| **Driver's License** | x3 Mult if 16+ enhanced cards in deck. Huge payoff for enhancement-heavy builds. |
| **Steel Joker** | xMult based on Steel cards in deck. Core of Steel card builds. |
| **Card Sharp** | x3 Mult if same hand type played twice in one round. Easy to trigger with Pair/High Card. |
| **Shortcut** | Straights can skip 1 rank between cards. Makes Straights trivially easy. Build-defining. |
| **Baron** | x1.5 Mult for each King held in hand. Core of the King/Steel build. |
| **Sock and Buskin** | Retriggers all face cards scored. Doubles face card value. |
| **Smeared Joker** | Hearts=Diamonds, Clubs=Spades for suit purposes. Doubles Flush consistency. |
| **Throwback** | +x0.25 Mult per skipped Blind. Retroactive. Rewards skip-heavy play. |
| **Oops! All 6s** | Doubles all listed probabilities. Makes Lucky Cards, Bloodstone, Business Card near-guaranteed. |

## Build Archetypes

### 1. Flush Build
- **Archetype:** flush
- **Difficulty:** Easy (beginner-friendly)
- **Key Jokers:** Smeared Joker, Bloodstone, The Tribe (x2 Mult if Flush), Ancient Joker, Greedy/Lusty/Gluttonous/Wrathful Joker (suit-specific Mult)
- **Priority Hands:** Flush, Flush Five, Flush House
- **How it works:** Use Tarot cards (Lovers, Empress, etc.) to convert all cards to one suit. Smeared Joker halves the suits needed. Checkered Deck starts with only 2 suits.
- **Shop Rules:** Buy suit-changing Tarots aggressively. Prioritize Jupiter (Flush planet). Pick up Smeared Joker ASAP.
- **Ante Progression:** Works well through Ante 5-6. Needs xMult Jokers (Bloodstone, The Tribe) to scale into Ante 7-8.
- **Weakness:** Boss Blinds that debuff specific suits can cripple you. Keep Director's Cut or Luchador as insurance.
- **Source:** GameRant, Twinfinite, 9game.cn

### 2. Pairs / Two Pair / Full House Build
- **Archetype:** pairs
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Jokers:** The Duo (x2 Mult with Pair), Spare Trousers (+2 Mult per Two Pair played), Half Joker (+20 Mult for ≤3 card hands), Card Sharp (x3 Mult same hand twice)
- **Priority Hands:** Pair, Two Pair, Full House, eventually Five of a Kind
- **How it works:** Small hands (2-3 cards) trigger Half Joker. The Duo gives x2 on any Pair. Spare Trousers scales with Two Pair plays. Full House contains Pair + Three of a Kind, triggering multiple Jokers.
- **Shop Rules:** Buy Duo/Trio early. Use Strength Tarot to create matching ranks. Planet cards for Pair/Two Pair.
- **Ante Progression:** Very consistent early. Scales well with xMult jokers mid-game.
- **Weakness:** The Psychic (must play 5 cards) is problematic. Splash Joker can help.
- **Source:** TheGamer, Reddit, PC Gamer Forums

### 3. Straight Build
- **Archetype:** straight
- **Difficulty:** Medium-Hard (without Shortcut), Easy (with Shortcut)
- **Key Jokers:** Shortcut (skip 1 rank in Straights), Four Fingers (4-card Straights/Flushes), Runner (+15 Chips per Straight played), Wee Joker
- **Priority Hands:** Straight, Straight Flush (with Four Fingers)
- **How it works:** Shortcut makes Straights trivially easy (e.g., 2-4-6-8-10 counts). Four Fingers reduces requirement to 4 cards. Combined = Straight Flush with 4 cards that can skip ranks.
- **Shop Rules:** Shortcut is the #1 priority. Four Fingers is the dream combo. Saturn (Straight planet) for leveling.
- **Ante Progression:** Shortcut alone can carry to Ante 6+. With Four Fingers, Straight Flush becomes the primary hand.
- **Weakness:** Without Shortcut, Straights are inconsistent. Deck thinning helps.
- **Source:** GameRant, SteelSeries

### 4. Four of a Kind Build
- **Archetype:** four_kind
- **Difficulty:** Hard
- **Key Jokers:** The Family (x2 Mult with Four of a Kind), Hologram (xMult when cards added), DNA (clones cards), Mime (retrigger held-in-hand effects)
- **Priority Hands:** Four of a Kind, Five of a Kind (with Spectral cards)
- **How it works:** Use Ouija/Cryptid Spectral cards to create duplicate ranks. DNA clones your best card each round. Erratic Deck helps with random rank distribution.
- **Shop Rules:** Spectral cards (Ouija, Cryptid) are critical. Planet card for Four of a Kind.
- **Ante Progression:** Hard to set up early. Becomes overwhelming once 4+ copies of a rank exist.
- **Weakness:** Requires specific Spectral cards. The Pillar (can't replay same cards) is dangerous.
- **Source:** TheGamer, Reddit

### 5. High Card Build
- **Archetype:** high_card
- **Difficulty:** Advanced
- **Key Jokers:** Supernova (+Mult per times hand played), Burnt Joker (+10 Chips/+1 Mult per round from leveling), Green Joker (+1 Mult per hand played), Square Joker (+4 Chips per hand played), Card Sharp (x3 Mult same hand twice)
- **Priority Hands:** High Card (exclusively)
- **How it works:** Play only High Card every single hand. Supernova scales with play count. Burnt Joker auto-levels your hand. Minimizes variables for maximum consistency.
- **Shop Rules:** Pluto (High Card planet) is essential. Avoid anything that doesn't support High Card.
- **Ante Progression:** Slow start but extremely consistent. Scales predictably.
- **Weakness:** Low base chips/mult. Needs multiple scaling Jokers to work.
- **Source:** GameRant, Steam Community, YouTube

### 6. Face Card / King Build (Baron + Steel)
- **Archetype:** face_cards
- **Difficulty:** Hard (requires specific pieces)
- **Key Jokers:** Baron (x1.5 Mult per King held), Mime (retrigger held-in-hand effects), Triboulet (x2 Mult per King/Queen played), Sock and Buskin (retrigger face cards), Pareidolia (all cards count as face cards)
- **Priority Hands:** Any hand — the power comes from held Kings with Steel enhancement
- **How it works:** Convert all cards to Steel Kings. Baron gives x1.5 per King held. Mime retriggers held-in-hand effects. With Juggler/Troubadour increasing hand size to 11, each Steel King contributes ~x5 Mult. Pareidolia makes ALL cards face cards for even more synergy.
- **Shop Rules:** Death Tarot to copy Kings. Spectral cards for Steel enhancement. Juggler/Troubadour for hand size.
- **Ante Progression:** Once assembled, beats virtually any blind. Setup takes until Ante 4-5.
- **Weakness:** The Mark (face cards drawn face down) and The Plant (face cards debuffed) are hard counters.
- **Source:** Balatro Wiki (Fandom), SteelSeries

### 7. Lucky Card / Probability Build
- **Archetype:** lucky
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Jokers:** Oops! All 6s (double all probabilities), Lucky Cat (xMult per Lucky card trigger), Bloodstone, Business Card, Reserved Parking
- **Priority Hands:** Any hand with Lucky-enhanced cards
- **How it works:** Oops! All 6s makes 1-in-2 chances guaranteed. Stack deck with Lucky cards. Lucky Cat snowballs xMult. Glass Joker also benefits (Glass cards break faster = more xMult).
- **Shop Rules:** Tarot cards to create Lucky enhancements. Oops! All 6s is the build-defining piece.
- **Ante Progression:** Inconsistent without Oops! All 6s. Very strong with it.
- **Source:** TheGamer

### 8. Scaling / Snowball Build
- **Archetype:** scaling
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Key Jokers:** Hiker (+5 Chips permanently per played card), Runner (+15 Chips per Straight), Constellation (xMult per Planet used), Wee Joker (+10 Chips per 2 scored), Square Joker (+4 Chips per hand if exactly 4 cards)
- **Priority Hands:** Whatever triggers your scaling Jokers most often
- **How it works:** Pick up scaling Jokers early (Ante 1-2) so they compound over the entire run. Every round makes them stronger.
- **Shop Rules:** Buy scaling Jokers ASAP. They lose value the later you pick them up.
- **Ante Progression:** Weak early, overwhelming late. Must survive to Ante 4-5 for payoff.
- **Source:** TheGamer, Hex Shift (Medium)

### 9. Economy / Ceremonial Dagger Build
- **Archetype:** economy
- **Difficulty:** Niche
- **Key Jokers:** Ceremonial Dagger (gains Mult = sell value of destroyed right-side Joker), Egg (+$3 sell value per round), Golden Joker, Cloud 9
- **Priority Hands:** Any — this build is about Joker manipulation
- **How it works:** Buy cheap Jokers, feed them to Ceremonial Dagger. Egg grows in sell value over time for a massive sacrifice. Green Deck synergizes.
- **Shop Rules:** Discount vouchers are critical. Buy and sacrifice Jokers constantly.
- **Ante Progression:** Slow buildup. Egg needs many rounds to become valuable.

## Economy & Shop Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **Interest is king.** You earn $1 per $5 held, up to $5 at $25. Get to $25 ASAP and stay there.
2. **Early economy Jokers pay for themselves.** Rocket, Golden Joker, Cloud 9, To The Moon — pick these up in Ante 1-2.
3. **Don't reroll early unless desperate.** Each reroll costs $5. In Ante 1-2, buy what's offered or save.
4. **Mid-game: stop chasing dream Jokers.** By Ante 4-5, your build skeleton should be set. Spend on Tarot/Planet packs instead.
5. **Late game: spend everything on survival.** At Ante 7-8, money sitting in your pocket is wasted. Buy consumables aggressively.

### Shop Buying Priority (by game phase)

#### Ante 1-2 (Early)
1. Any Chip or Mult Joker (Scary Face, Smiley Face, Odd Todd, Even Steven, base Joker)
2. Economy Joker (Rocket, Golden Joker, Egg)
3. Planet card for your primary hand type
4. Tarot cards for deck modification

#### Ante 3-5 (Mid)
1. xMult Jokers (Card Sharp, Bloodstone, The Duo/Trio/Family)
2. Scaling Jokers (Fortune Teller, Spare Trousers, Ride the Bus)
3. Planet packs (level up your primary hand)
4. Tarot packs (enhance/thin deck)
5. Vouchers (Director's Cut, Overstock, Hone/Glow Up)

#### Ante 6-8 (Late)
1. Any xMult Joker you can find
2. Blueprint/Brainstorm if available
3. Consumables for boss blind survival
4. Deck thinning (Hanged Man Tarot)

### Key Vouchers
- **Director's Cut / Reroll Surplus:** Reroll Boss Blinds. Critical for avoiding hard counters.
- **Overstock / Overstock Plus:** More cards in shop = more chances for key Jokers.
- **Hone / Glow Up:** Better odds of Foil/Holo/Polychrome editions.
- **Money Tree / Seed Money:** Raise interest cap to $10 at $50. Massive economy boost.
- **Blank / Antimatter:** Extra Joker slot. More Jokers = more power.

### Universal Formula (from Chinese community)
> **1 Economy Joker + 1-2 Scaling Jokers + 1 Utility Joker + 2-3 xMult Jokers = ~80% win rate**

## Boss Blind Counter-Strategies

### Suit-Debuffing Bosses
- **The Verdant / The Crimson / etc.** (debuff a specific suit): Don't over-commit to one suit. Keep 2+ suits viable, or use Smeared Joker to merge suits.
- **Counter:** Director's Cut to reroll. Luchador (sell during Boss Blind to disable effect).

### The Psychic (must play 5 cards)
- **Problem for:** Small hand builds (Pair, High Card with Half Joker)
- **Counter:** Splash Joker (all cards count for scoring). Just play 5 cards with your pair inside.

### The Pillar (cards played previously are debuffed)
- **Problem for:** Decks that replay the same cards
- **Counter:** Large/varied deck. Skip Small/Big Blinds before reaching it to preserve cards.

### Face-Down Bosses (The Fish)
- **Counter:** Don't rely on seeing your cards. Play hands that work regardless. Luchador.

### The Mark (face cards drawn face down)
- **Problem for:** Face card builds
- **Counter:** Avoid face card dependency, or use Luchador/Director's Cut.

### The Plant (face cards debuffed)
- **Problem for:** Face card builds (Baron, Triboulet, Sock and Buskin)
- **Counter:** Hard counter — reroll with Director's Cut or skip.

### General Boss Blind Tips
1. **Always check the Boss Blind at the start of each Ante.** Plan your plays around it.
2. **Hold consumables in reserve** for Boss Blind rounds. Don't waste your best Tarot on Small Blind.
3. **Consistency beats peak power.** A hand that scores reliably for all plays beats chasing one massive hand.
4. **Luchador is insurance.** Sell it during a Boss Blind to disable the effect entirely. Negative Luchador = reusable insurance.

## Early Game vs Late Game Priorities

### Early Game (Ante 1-3)

**Goals:**
- Obtain at least 1 solid Chips or Mult Joker (without one, you die at Ante 2 Boss)
- Establish economy (reach $25 for max interest)
- Identify your build direction based on what's offered (don't pre-commit)

**Priority Jokers:**
- Scary Face, Smiley Face, Odd Todd, Even Steven (conditional Chips/Mult)
- Suit Jokers (Wrathful, Lusty, Gluttonous, Greedy) for early Mult
- Base Joker, Abstract Joker, Swashbuckler as slot fillers
- Gros Michel (grab early so Cavendish can appear sooner when it breaks)

**Key Decisions:**
- Aggressive rerolling is correct in Ante 1-2 — early Jokers compound over the entire run
- Pick up scaling Jokers (Hiker, Constellation, Wee Joker) ASAP — they lose value later
- Don't commit to a build too early. Let the shop guide you.

### Mid Game (Ante 4-6)

**Goals:**
- Pivot to 1-2 specific hand types
- Acquire xMult Jokers (essential for Ante 7-8)
- Level up your primary hand with Planet cards
- Enhance playing cards with Tarots

**Priority:**
- At least 1 +Chip Joker, 1 +Mult Joker (preferably scaling), and xMult Jokers
- Edition Jokers (Foil, Holographic, Polychrome) can substitute for Chip/Mult sources
- Keep money above $25 for interest at all times
- Watch for Boss Blinds that counter your build — get Director's Cut

### Late Game (Ante 7-8+)

**Goals:**
- Survive. Every coin should convert to survival, scaling, or consumables.
- Stop building — start optimizing what you have
- Thin your deck aggressively (Hanged Man)

**Priority:**
- xMult Jokers are non-negotiable. Without them, you cannot beat Ante 7-8 blinds.
- Blueprint/Brainstorm if available
- Consumables for emergency scoring
- Don't hoard money — spend it all

### Tempo vs Scaling (Advanced Concept)
- **Tempo decks** win quickly with reliable hands and steady multipliers. Push for consistent wins.
- **Scaling decks** start weak but become overwhelming. Focus on survival until engine is online.
- **Most common mid-game failure:** Misidentifying your deck type. A tempo deck played as scaling = underpowered by Ante 6. A scaling deck played aggressively = burns out before engine starts.

---

## Advanced Principles

### The Holy Trinity of Jokers
Every strong run needs three components:
1. **Chip Joker** (Square, Stuntman) — raw points to survive early
2. **Scaling Mult Joker** (Green Joker, Supernova, Spare Trousers) — grows over time
3. **xMult Jokers** (Card Sharp, Acrobat, Bloodstone) — magnifies everything

### Joker Order Matters
- Jokers are scored left to right
- Place +Chips and +Mult Jokers on the LEFT
- Place xMult Jokers on the RIGHT
- This way, accumulated Chips/Mult gets multiplied by xMult at the end

### Deck Thinning
- Thin decks are winning decks. Fewer duds = more consistent power hands.
- Use Hanged Man Tarot to remove cards you never play.
- Trading Card destroys 1 card per round + gives $3.
- A 20-card deck draws power hands almost every time.

### Reroll Discipline
- **Ante 1-2:** Aggressive rerolling is correct. Early Jokers compound.
- **Ante 3-5:** Reroll less. Stabilize economy. Buy packs instead.
- **Ante 6-8:** Reroll only for specific missing pieces. Spend on consumables.

### Probability Awareness
- Memorize your outs. Know how many cards complete your target hand.
- Don't waste 2-3 discards chasing a 1-in-20 draw.
- Treat each hand like debugging: most efficient, least variable solution wins.

### Consumable Management
- Hold consumables in reserve for Boss Blinds
- Don't waste your best Tarot/Planet on Small Blind
- Emperor (2 random Tarots) is extremely valuable with Fortune Teller

### Skipping Blinds
- Skipping Small/Big Blinds gives Tags (bonuses) but no money
- Throwback Joker rewards skipping (+x0.25 Mult per skip, retroactive)
- Skip when: you have strong economy, the tag is valuable, or you need to preserve Seltzer charges
- Don't skip when: you need money or your build is weak

## Chinese Community Insights

### 同花流 (Flush Build) — Low Difficulty Guide
**Source:** 9game.cn, Bilibili

- Flush can carry through Ante 1-2 easily
- For Ante 1 (300 score), a Straight may actually outscore a Flush — plan your final hand carefully
- When a Boss debuffs a suit: debuffed cards don't score but still count for hand type. Play them anyway if they complete a hand.
- At low difficulty, playing all rounds for money is better than skipping for tags
- Late game: switch to High Card/Pair because strong hand types don't have significant advantage over exponentially growing Boss scores — High Card/Pair trigger more Joker effects

### 万用通关公式 (Universal Win Formula)
**Source:** Zhihu (知乎)

> 1 Economy + 1-2 Scaling + 1 Utility + 2-3 High Mult = ~80% win rate

Build your Joker lineup following this template. Don't fill all 5 slots with damage — you need economy and utility too.

### 金注攻略 (Gold Stake Guide)
**Source:** Keylol, Zhihu, Bilibili

Key insights for Gold Stake (hardest difficulty):
- Gold Stake reduces hand size by 1 AND applies all 7 previous stake effects
- **This is NOT a hand-type game — it's a Joker synergy game.** All card selection follows Joker needs.
- Don't buy Planet cards just to level hands — only level the hand your Jokers support
- Economy is even more critical at Gold Stake. Pack costs increase. Get to $25 interest ASAP.
- Rental Jokers (cost $3/round) are fine late game but dangerous early
- Blueprint + any strong Joker is often the win condition
- Negative edition (no slot used) on any Joker is extremely valuable

### 小丑搭配 (Joker Synergy Combos)
**Source:** Bilibili (全金注玩家攻略), 旅法师营地 (Iyingdi)

Popular combos in Chinese community:
1. **Baron + Mime + Steel Kings** — Each held Steel King = ~x5 Mult
2. **Blueprint + Brainstorm + any xMult** — Triple the effect of your best Joker
3. **Oops! All 6s + Lucky Cards + Lucky Cat** — Guaranteed Lucky triggers, snowballing xMult
4. **DNA + Hologram** — DNA adds cards, Hologram gains xMult per card added
5. **Perkeo + Hermit** — Infinite money generation via Negative Hermit copies
6. **四指 (Four Fingers) + Shortcut** — 4-card gap-Straights = easy Straight Flush

### 牌组构筑原则 (Deck Building Principles)
**Source:** Zhihu

- **留强去弱** (Keep strong, remove weak) — Always thin your deck
- For Flush: remove the suit with fewest cards, add the suit with most
- For Straight: ensure even distribution of all ranks. Delete from 2 upward to avoid gaps.
- For Pairs/Four of a Kind: use Spectral cards (Ouija, Cryptid) to duplicate ranks
